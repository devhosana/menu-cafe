# Menu Caf√©

**Description**

My very first real world project, QR code coffee shop menu, simple and yet challeging (as it is my first React project), in the future I plan to add back-end capabilities to make the user edit it by himself and maybe integrate it in an ERP specialized for coffee shops.

**How it works**

The customer scan the QR code in his table and see the prices of meals, coffees, beverages on his device, as simple as that. 

**What I use here**

- React version 18.2.0
